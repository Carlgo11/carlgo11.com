  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
  <p>I’m an information-security and cryptography enthusiast from Sweden.<br>
    On my spare time I like to write code, play building games (like SimCity, Cities Skylines, Prison
    Architect etc) & take apart stuff and see how they work.<br>
    I’m a super curious person and so I love learning new things! That is partly how I became interested in
    computers to begin with.</p>

  <h2>My projects</h2>
  <p>I'm active on a bunch of open source projects, most of which are on
    <a href="https://github.com/Carlgo11/">GitHub</a>.
    <br/>Below is a list of active as well as inactive
    projects I've created or worked on:</p>

  <div class="row" id="project-list">
    {% for project_array in site.data.projects %}
    {% assign project = project_array[1] %}
    {% assign name = project_array[0] %}

    <div class="card noselect">
      <a href="{{ project.url }}">
        <img loading="lazy" class="card-img-top" src="{{ project.img }}">
      </a>
      <div class="card-body">
        <a href="{{ project.url }}"><h5 class="card-title">{{ name }} {% if project.archived %}<i class="bi bi-archive-fill"></i>{% endif %}</h5></a>
        <hr>
        <p class="card-text">{{ project.description }}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    {% endfor %}

  <h2>Q&A</h2>
  <h4>Favorite OS?</h4>
  <p>GNU/Linux based distributions but MacOS works fine as well.<br>
    As long as it's UNIX based it's fine.</p>
  <h4>Favorite Passwords?</h4>
  <p>Those that can't be read by humans</p>
  <h4>Favorite programming language?</h4>
  <p>PHP because of how fast it is to make things in.<br>
    I also started coding in Java so the leap from Java to PHP is pretty insignificant.</p>
  <h4>Worst vulnerability?</h4>
  <p>SQL injection. How is this still a thing?!<br>
    Tom Scott did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jKylhJtPmI">great video</a> on this.</p>
  <h4>What's your mother's maiden name?</h4>
  <pre>cat /dev/urandom</pre>
