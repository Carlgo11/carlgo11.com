### What is GateKeeper?

GateKeeper is a small bluetooth dongle best fitting on a keychain. The bluetooth dongle talks to the little USB stick that you also get. (see picture below)

Just plug the USB stick into a USB port on your PC/Mac (preferably on the front, as it will need a good signal). You can then configure what the dongle will do on your computer, using the software that GateKeeper provides. Either set it to lock automatically, unlock automatically, or both.

### What do I think about it?

I really like the neat little gadget since I usually don't lock my computer when I leave it. Here I don't have to think about it. When I leave the computer it locks, and when I come back it unlocks without me doing anything.

That being said, I would really like to see an API and the source code for the software they provide, as well as a GateKeeper for Linux distributions.

A little more customization abilities would also be neat, since I'd rather have my computer shut down when I leave, instead of just going to the Windows login screen that could easily be overwritten .

I've talked to the guys behind GateKeeper and they've told me they're working on an API. They did however not give me an ETA, so my guess is that it won't be released.

Even though I'm not their primary target group, I have to say I find it very handy to have one. Even more than I thought I would.

I probably wouldn't buy one myself at the moment, but I really think less tech-savvy people should buy one (and preferably those who don't run Linux on their work computers).

It surely is a neat gadget, and I would love to see companies giving these out to their employees to prevent snooping in the office.

**The GateKeeper also have other functionalities for phones but I have chosen not to dig too much into that.**

_Disclaimer: While I did receive a test sample by Untethered Labs, LLC (the people behind GateKeeper) I have no obligation to write something good about their product. These thoughts are my own and my own alone._
