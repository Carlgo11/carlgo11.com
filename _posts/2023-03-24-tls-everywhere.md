For the past 10 years, there's been a drive to make web traffic be encrypted in transit. Partly fueled by Let's Encrypt, TLS is now supported by most public websites. In fact, w3techs.com reports that 82% of all tracked websites now serve HTTPS by default.[__ยน__](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-httpsdefault)

In this article, I'll go over the steps I did to implement TLS encryption for my LAN traffic. One of the last frontiers not yet covered by HTTPS.

## Attack surface

So why is HTTPS important in a LAN? Well... it mostly isn't. For a home network like mine, there's no real reason to implement HTTPS except to challenge oneself and possibly bragging rights. Does this give you bragging rights? Idk, try it out at the next party you're in and post the result.

## Background and constraints

As all traffic is within my own LAN I get to dictate the security level so I set out to only use TLSv1.3 whenever possible.
Depending on which devices you'll have to deal with you may need to adjust the accepted TLS versions and ciphers.
I also set out to encrypt as much of the traffic chain as possible. If the end service supports TLS I'll enable TLS. If not I'll settle for a proxy on the same machine.

My LAN is constantly evolving into a more complex web of interconnections but heavily simplified, the relevant areas look like this:

Each service (box) can be a physical server, virtual machine or docker container, but the procedures are the same regardless.
All clients are on the User VLAN and traffic between the two VLANS are controlled by the UniFi Controller.

## Let's Encrypt and DNS

The vanilla behavior of most ACME-compatible scripts is to verify domain ownership by serving a token via HTTP on the domain in question. Since Let's Encrypt can't reach a website inside your LAN, ownership needs to be verified through DNS.
Several open-source tools do this and the most common way is through [dehydrated](https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated) hooks.

Check their [wiki](https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated/wiki#dns-providers) for a tool that matches your DNS provider, and if you're using Cloudflare I'd like to shamelessly plug my own [Dehydrated CF Docker Image](https://github.com/Carlgo11/dehydrated-docker).

## IoT

What is the LAN but not a way for your fridge to communicate with your NAS?
Since most IoT setups are designed for the IoT device to initiate the communication, only the central control unit needs a TLS certificate. The devices then simply initiate an HTTPS connection with the control unit.

### Homebridge

As someone bound by the shackles of the Apple ecosystem, I chose [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) as the control unit. Homebridge is like [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) _Lite_ and is intended to integrate with HomeKit on an Apple Homepod or AppleTV.

HomeBridge features [Homebridge UI](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x#readme) as the default web dashboard. Homebridge UI doesn't in itself support TLS encryption so I ended up putting an Nginx proxy in front of the dashboard. This means that the traffic is TLS encrypted all the way from the client to the proxy but from the proxy to the dashboard it's unencrypted. As I keep both services on the same computer I find this solution to be good enough.

### MQTT

As an MQTT broker, I chose Mosquitto along with Cedalo Management Center, both run as Docker containers.
The MQTT protocol supports TLS through MQTTS but some low-powered MQTT clients may not be able to handle TLS encryption in which case you'll need to have both port 8883 _(MQTTS)_ and 1883 _(MQTT)_ open.

docker-compose.yml:
```YAML
version: "3.6"
services:
  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:2-openssl
    ports:
      #- 1883:1883 #MQTT
      - 8883:8883 #MQTTS
    volumes:
      - ./config:/mosquitto/config
      - ./data:/mosquitto/data
      - ./log:/mosquitto/log
    restart: unless-stopped
  management-center:
    image: cedalo/management-center:2.2.3
    ports:
      - 8088:8088
    depends_on:
      - mosquitto
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      CEDALO_MC_BROKER_ID: mosquitto-2.0
      CEDALO_MC_BROKER_NAME: Mosquitto 2.0
      CEDALO_MC_BROKER_URL: mqtts://<mqtt domain>:8883
      CEDALO_MC_BROKER_USERNAME: <service username>
      CEDALO_MC_BROKER_PASSWORD: <service password>
      CEDALO_MC_USERNAME: <admin username>
      CEDALO_MC_PASSWORD: <admin password>
      CEDALO_STREAMSHEETS_ID: streamsheets-local
      CEDALO_STREAMSHEETS_NAME: Streamsheets
      CEDALO_STREAMSHEETS_DESCRIPTION: Local Streamsheets
      CEDALO_STREAMSHEETS_URL: http://localhost:8081
```
I then proxy the management page on port 8088 to Nginx to get TLS encryption for the management portal.

For MQTTS via Mosquitto:
1. Get an x509 certificate for the domain name you intend to use for MQTT.
1. Copy the fullchain.pem and privkey.pem to the data diretory of the Mosquitto container.
   This should subsequently be done through an automated script upon certificate renewal.
1. Open `config/mosquitto.conf` and add the following:
   ```
   #listen 1883
   listener 8883

   certfile /mosquitto/data/cert.pem
   keyfile /mosquitto/data/key.pem
   tls_version tlsv1.3

   ```

## NTP

[Network Time Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol), the backbone of RFC-6238.
Of course, I needed an NTP server on my home network. But what if my fridge or dishwasher spoofs the NTP traffic?!
NTS to the rescue! NTS is a [new extension](](https://blog.cloudflare.com/nts-is-now-rfc/)) to NTP that implements message authentication through TLS.

Currently [chrony](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/) and [ntpsec](https://ntpsec.org/) support NTS. I chose NTPSec for both the server and clients.
The setup is really easy.

On the server:
1. Install ntpsec through a package manager and place your x509 certificate on the server.
1. Open `/etc/ntp.conf` (or sometimes `/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf`) and add the following lines:
  ```
  nts cert <certificate path>
  nts key <certificate key path>
  nts mintls TLS1.3
  nts enable
  ```
  The server now accepts NTS traffic through TLSv1.3.
1. To broadcast an exact time, you either want to connect to other NTS servers or install your own GPS reciever on the server.
See the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NTPsec) on more info on that.

On the client:
1. Install ntpsec through a package manager.
1. Open `/etc/ntp.conf` (or sometimes `/etc/ntpsec/ntp.conf`) and add the following line:
  ```
  server <nts server address> nts
  ```
1. Restart the ntpsec service: `service ntpsec restart`

### UniFi

The Ubiquiti ecosystem is interesting, to say the least. Like a mix between Cisco, Google and Apple; Behind the modern locked-down web UIs hides a modified version of Alpine Linux.
If, like me, you use a UniFi controller running UniFi OS 3, the TLS certificate and key for all UniFi dashboards are located in `/data/unifi-core/config/` as `unifi-core.crt` and `unifi-core.key`.
So to get a valid certificate all you have to do is run an ACME client (like [dehydrated](https://github.com/dehydrated-io/dehydrated)) off device and then SFTP the result to the aforementioned path. SSH/SFTP can be enabled on the UniFi Controller's Settings page under _Console Controls_.

However, if you want a more automated approach I recommend you try out [ubios-cert](https://github.com/alxwolf/ubios-cert).
